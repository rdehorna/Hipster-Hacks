                    <hr class="primary">
                    <p>Building your 3D object is very similar to building structures with Legos. Imagine drawing a digital picture on the computer, and printing this out in a regular office printer. Your image is of course 2D. But now, if you could printer multiple layers of 2D images on top of each other, you have added the Z-axis to your image and given it depth, therefore creating a 3D object. This is the principle behind 3D printing, where you are creating various 3D shapes by isolating the geometries of the object of interest. We have included a quick tutorial and explanation of OpenSCAD to show the principle behind working with geometries for creating 3D CAD models. <br></br>

                    More basics can be found here: <br></br>

                        First, there are a series of free and paid programs that allow you to create 3D models. Each comes with its own learning curve.<br> 

                        Free programs include (but are not limited to):<br>
                        
                            <a href=”http://www.sketchup.com/”>SketchUp</a><br>

                        Available to faculty, staff and students at the University of Arizona is free use of Solidworks so long as your computer is connected to UA Wifi—VPN works too. Both AutoDesk and Solidworks can be downloaded at: <a href” http://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/”> http://softwarelicense.arizona.edu</a><br></br>

                        <strong><i>2. Use the tools available in your program of choice to create your model, or download your 3D model from a free or paid online source! </i></strong> <br></br>

                        The easiest thing to do if you do not want to create your own 3D models is to look online for 3D models. Sites such as <a href=”http://www.thingiverse.com/”>Thingiverse</a>, hosted by Makerbot, a 3D printing company, contain many models that users have uploaded, most of which are open source under the <a href=”http://creativecommons.org/licenses/”>Creative Commons license</a> for other users to remix (remake) or to build off of. <br></br>

                        Before you begin creating your own 3D models, please note that the Internet is an amazing wealth of knowledge; many helpful people have uploaded YouTube videos teaching how to use each of these programs. Many tutorials exist that can at least help steer you in the right direction. <br></br>


                        <strong><i>3. Each of the programs mentioned offer an option to save the 3D model as an .STL file. </i></strong><br></br>

                        Similar to saving a .jpeg picture file as a .png file, you can save your 3D model as an .STL file. There are also many conversion programs available for doing this. <br></br>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to operate a 3D printer</h2>
                        <hr class="light">
                          

                            The 2 most common types of plastic filaments used currently are ABS and PLA plastics. Both of these plastics have slightly different properties (melting temperature, brittleness, etc.), and can be “finished” with chemical treatments. For example, acetone is a solvent that melts ABS plastic. As a result, an acetone treatment can be performed on finished prints to uniformly melt the ABS plastic such that all of the layers on the surface melt together and your surface becomes smooth (instead of the usual printer layers that are clearly visible when observed).<br></br>

                            If you do not have prior experience, before running your 3D printer: read the instructions, consult seasoned users, or call up the company if you are unable to figure out what to do! Many cities have hackerspaces with many great people from the community who are just excited about hacking and would be more than happy to help you! Many even teach their own 3D printing classes. <a class="orange"  href=” http://www.xerocraft.org/”>Xerocraft</a> in Tucson, AZ is one such wonderful land of awesome.<br></br>

                            <strong><i>Printer specific machine code for telling the 3D printer what to do</i></strong><br></br>

                            Many 3D printers operate using a language called “G-code.” G-code is a programming language that machines use to know how to make things. This code tells where the printer head should move in a plane, how fast to extrude plastic, how fast to move, what temperature to heat the nozzle to, and when to move the Z-axis. In other words, G-code tells the machine tool what action to perform, and how.<br></br>

                            Luckily, beginners do not have to know how to work with G-code. Programs such as <a class="orange"  href=”http://replicat.org/”>Replicator G</a>, which is available for Mac, Windows or Linux, can import your .STL file, and auto-generate the G-code file that you can customize for your type of printer. Within Replicator G, you can select the type of printer you have (although some models are not listed), and input the travel and feed rate of the plastic filament through the print head. Depending on the print, support materials or a 2 to 3 layer raft can be used to aid in printing unusual or complex figures. The reason to use support materials includes the times when the printer head cannot print, for example, the arm of a figurine in mid-air, because there is nowhere for the filament to deposit. Support material will provide a makeshift surface for an object to print onto that can be removed later. <br></br>

                            However, even though some printers do not use G-code, they will come with their own programs that can import an STL file and generate its own machine code. <br></br>

                            Importantly, when you are creating your G-code file for your printer, make sure that your 3D object is actually centered and laying flat on your build plate/plane. Otherwise, your compiled G-code will be configured to print you a slanted and less-than-optimal object! In some cases, you many not even succeed in printing if the object is not touching the build plane.<br></br>

                            <strong><i>Assuming you’ve created a file suitable for printing that your 3D printer can read, here are some things to consider</i></strong><br></br>

                            For one, check that your build plate is level. Each printer comes with an option to “level build plates” that is often found in a Utilities folder. Knobs to manually level the build plate are usually found underneath the print bed.<br></br>

                            Next, make sure the surface of your print bed is clear, and flat. If there is thermal Kapton tape, 3M's Scotch-Blue 2090 tape, or other tape on the print bed surface, check for imperfections, bubbles, or rips in the material. Replace the tape if needed. <br></br>

                            While creating the G-code file, you may need to alter parameters such as the filament travel and feed rates, temperatures (depending on what type of filament you are using), or % infill. The pattern of how your fill in the hollow portion of your 3D object can also be changed, such that less or more material is used. <br></br>

                            <strong><i>Running a 3D printer</strong></i><br></br>

                            Each printer comes with its own quirks and needs, kind of like a pet. You will notice that your specific 3D printer will need some help to complete certain printing tasks, and experience on what to do in different situations can often only be gained through trial-and-error. Luckily, there are tons of online forums detailing the complications of 3D printing, and there are many solutions posted by users. Troubleshooting can get complicated, but oftentimes, users have fairly simply solutions for commonly encountered problems. Solutions can be as simple as putting a cardboard box over your 3D printer for insulation and temperature regulation.<br></br>

                            In practice, printers oftentimes are able to run directly from a laptop through a USB connection, or will have an LED microcontroller that reads from an SD disk. Therefore, printing can be initiated from the computer, or the printer G-code can be uploaded to the SD disk and initiated using the controller buttons on the LED display. <br></br>

                            It is a good idea to stick around long enough to watch the printer lay down the first few lines or layers of your print, to insure that the filament is correctly depositing onto the print bed. This way, you can catch issues that arise initially quickly so that when you return, you have a successfully printed 3D object!<br></br>

                        <center><img src="img/openSCAD_bike_light_mount.JPG"></img></center>
                         <p>OpenSCAD is a free program that can be downloaded at <a class="orange"  href=”http://www.openscad.org”>www.openscad.org</a><br></br>

                            Further documentation and tutorial links can be found at the openscad.org website as well. <br>

                            Before we begin, please check out this very helpful article published on the Cubehero blog: <br>
                            <a class="orange" href=” http://blog.cubehero.com/2013/11/19/know-only-10-things-to-be-dangerous-in-openscad/”>“Know only 10 things to be dangerous in OpenSCAD”</a><br>

                            Using just these basic functions highlighted in the Cubehero blog post, you can now begin to play with various 3D CAD geometries!<br>

                            First, the light mount described here is remixed from an OpenSCAD bike light mount created by TheNewHobbyist and posted in Thingiverse: <a class="orange"  href” http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250899”> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250899</a><br>

                            We will now proceed to explain the OpenSCAD code for our remixed version, that can be found here: <a class="orange"  href=” http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131753”>OpenSCAD Code</a> <br>

                            First, bike specific parameters were considered. The diameter of European style handles are 26 mm on standard bikes. To give an idea of diameter and sizing, 1 inch = 25.4mm. It is ideal to create 3D printed objects with a bit of extra space, as the hot temperatures and subsequent cooling of extruded plastic can result in objects shrinking slightly.<br>

                            The measurements for this OpenSCAD object are all in mm. <br>

                            These measurements were used in the code, and each measurement was expressed as a variable. Statement of parameters as variables allows for easy customization by other users who want to remix objects such as this. <br>

                            Measurements include the light_thickness, which is the diameter of the flashlight you wish you attach via Velcro to your bike. Handle bar thickness is denoted by bar_thickness. Zip_thickness refers to the width of Zipties. The Velcro_thickness refers to the width of Velcro, which is 1 inch, in this case.<br>

                            <blockquote>
                            //All measurements are in mm
                            <br>light_thickness = 26.4;
                            <br>bar_thickness = 26.4;
                            <br>zip_thickness = 6.7;
                            <br>velcro_thickness = 25.4;
                            </blockquote><br>

                            This next part of code is simply for reference and aesthetics, for the coder to visualize the object in relation to the build plate. This code was downloaded from <a class="orange"  href=” http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44094”>Thingiverse</a> and integrated. By the way, a backslash with an asterisks, before and after code will result in it being “commented out”, which means that the code is not implemented. A double backslash will also do the trick, and it is often good practice to create comments throughout your code so that others can follow your logic.<br></br><br></br>

                            This part of the code is used for adjusting the final height of the object, which takes into account both the bar_thickness and light_thickness added together.

                            <blockquote>
                            /* [Hidden] */

                            <br><br>//holder box
                            <br>box_height = bar_thickness+light_thickness-17.6;
                            </blockquote>

                            As part of the instructions on compiling the build plate visualization, a folder named “utils” must be created within the same folder this scad file is housed such that the build_plate.scad can be used. We therefore direct use of the file through this code:

                            use <utils/build_plate.scad>


                            Each section of the light is divided into modules to group the geometric changes to the final object. Cube creates a cute; difference is the function use to subject one geometry from another; translate moves the alteration to a specific location; rotate will rotate the object at hand; and cylinder creates a cylinder shape. The order of operations matters in the code below. <br></br>
